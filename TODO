Logic for board. Look at both the ai-tools (which may be more efficient) and the snake4 (which may be more what we need for snake)
Then about object-board interaction
Still not 100% sure where the states are resolved. If everybody takes a turn, who is the guy who decides the final state of each move?
Think about where to put the AI logic
Think about the REST interface?
Maybe start adding the QT visualizer (just to learn PySide)
Maybe a console visualizer (just to play with interactive consoles)
